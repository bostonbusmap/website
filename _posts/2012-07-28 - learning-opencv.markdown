Yesterday I bought the O'Reilly book [Learning OpenCV](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516130.do) and it's a pretty good read. I took some courses in college on linear algebra and multivariable calculus so I'm decently prepared for the mathy parts. I've only skimmed a few chapters but I feel like I could have a deep understanding of certain things like edge detection through this book. But it's also helpful in providing good examples to start with.

There's been a lot of talk about the Kinect as a great advancement in what's cheaply available to people for computer vision. I have yet to get one myself, I guess I just forgot about it over time. There are a decent number of examples (including one in the book) which create a depth map from two cameras. I'm wondering what kind of quality to expect from a 3D model created from cell phone camera images, and how much pruning will need to be done. I think I'll start with the stereogram example code and go from there
