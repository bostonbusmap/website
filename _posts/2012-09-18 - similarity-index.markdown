'The Violet Femmes (Various Artists)' is so close, I guess it just got lost in the shuffle. None of these artists actually show up in my library, which isn't too surprising. The only artist I've seen which exists in my library is Alarm Will Sound, which shows up with a 20% familiarity rating compared against Jawbreaker.
